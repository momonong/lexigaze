# LexiGaze: Neuro-Symbolic Gaze Calibration for Edge AI

## 1. Project Overview
**LexiGaze** is an advanced research project focused on improving the accuracy of eye-tracking on consumer-grade edge devices (e.g., laptop webcams) using a **Neuro-Symbolic** approach.

The core challenge in webcam-based eye-tracking is the high level of noise, jitter, and systematic drift (+45px) caused by low-cost hardware. LexiGaze solves this by fusing "Neural" gaze data with "Symbolic" linguistic priors to "snap" gaze coordinates to the most likely target word.

## 2. Core Innovation: Cognitive Mass (CM)
The central innovation of LexiGaze is the concept of **Cognitive Mass (CM)**. We treat words in a sentence not just as spatial targets, but as objects with "linguistic gravity."

**$CognitiveMass = Surprisal \times AttentionCentrality$**

This score determines the "Gravity Radius" of a word, allowing the system to pull noisy gaze points toward cognitively heavy anchors.

## 3. Technical Architecture: STOCK-T
Our flagship architecture is the **Spatio-Temporal Oculomotor-Cognitive Kalman Transformer (STOCK-T)**:
- **Neural Perception**: 2D Gaussian likelihood modeling webcam noise.
- **Symbolic Cognition**: Linguistic priors (CM, OVP, Syntactic Depth).
- **Sequence Decoding**: Viterbi HMM with LLM-guided attention transitions.

## 4. Dataset: GECO L2 Corpus
We use the **Ghent Eye-Tracking Corpus (GECO)** English L2 reading data as our Ground Truth.
- **Subject focus**: `pp01` (Trial 5).
- **Environment**: Simulated +45px systematic vertical drift.

## 5. Experimental Results (NeurIPS Benchmark)
The following results represent our final unified metrics for Subject `pp01`, Trial 5 under extreme noise.

| Phase | Configuration | Accuracy (%) | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Baseline** | Raw Proximity (Nearest Box) | 18.6% | Fails under drift. |
| **Baseline** | Static Bayesian Snap | 16.7% | Point-based prior. |
| **Advanced** | Kalman Filter (Smoothing) | 2.6% | Locks in systematic drift. |
| **Breakthrough**| **Spatio-Temporal Viterbi (Base)**| **49.4%** | Sequence awareness. |
| **Milestone** | **Viterbi + EM Auto-Calibration**| **48.1%** | Self-correcting drift. |
| **Linguistic** | **STOCK-T v2 (Sparse Attention)**| **33.3%** | Captures cognitive look-backs. |

*Note: While rule-based Viterbi is strongest for linear reading, STOCK-T provides the cognitive framework necessary for complex linguistic behaviors (regressions).*
